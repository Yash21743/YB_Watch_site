## ‚öôÔ∏è How to run (Local)

1. Clone or copy the project folder to your machine.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox). No server required for static HTML/CSS/JS.
3. For development, open browser DevTools (F12) and use the mobile device toolbar to preview responsiveness.

If you later convert this to a hosted site, upload the folder to any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Ideas

* Replace placeholder images in `assets/images/` with high-quality product photos.
* Hook the contact form to a backend (Node / PHP / Formspree) to collect messages.
* Add product detail modals or a lightweight product carousel.
* Integrate a filter or category tabs for watch types (Analog / Digital / Luxury).
* Add simple animations using `@keyframes` or small libraries (AOS) for scroll reveal.

## ‚úÖ Accessibility & Responsiveness Notes

* Nav items switch to a fixed, slide-in menu under 768px width.
* Ensure images include meaningful `alt` attributes (already present for watch images).
* Use readable color contrasts for text on dark backgrounds (gold on black is used here). If you need WCAG-perfect contrast, consider slightly brighter text or subtle background overlays.

## üßæ Code Highlights

* `nav` JS: toggles `right` CSS property and swaps FontAwesome classes between `fa-bars` and `fa-times`.
* `.me::before` technique: preloads a background image and fades it in on hover for the About section.
* Responsive layout uses `@media (max-width: 800px)`/`768px` to stack gallery items.

## üì∏ Screenshots (recommended)

Include screenshots in `assets/screenshots/` such as:

* `desktop-home.png`
* `mobile-menu.png`
* `about-hover.png`

Add them to the repo and reference them in the README using `![alt text](assets/screenshots/desktop-home.png)`.
